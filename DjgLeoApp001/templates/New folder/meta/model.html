    <a id="model" name="model" href="#model">

<p>
    The model that the table will represent. This helps the table automatically inspect fields
    named by the <code>columns</code> list and find their <code>verbose_name</code> settings. If
    this is not declared, it can be provided automatically by the <code>model</code> attribute on
    the view or even the incoming object_list (which is often a queryset).
